<br>a four-phased narrative serious game tailored for undergraduate students, with a focus on enhancing their problem-solving skills using Mezirow theory. All assests are deisgned by Adobe illustrator and the game dvelopement is done by unity engine.

- Phase I: We conducted interviews with undergraduates to identify real-life problems and challenges.
- Phase II: We found possible solution strategies with the help of psychologists and educational scientists.
- Phase III: Based on the findings from the first two phases and Mezirow's Theory, the game is designed.
- Phase IV: We collected the test results from the players in order to write the research paper.
