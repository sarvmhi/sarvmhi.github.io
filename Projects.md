<br>a four-phased narrative serious game tailored for undergraduate students, with a focus on enhancing their problem-solving skills using Mezirow theory.
- Phase I: We conducted interviews with undergraduates to identify real-life problems and challenges.
- Phase II: find possible solution strategies by help of psychologists and educational scientists.
- Phase III: Upon the first two phasesâ€™ findings, and also Mezirow's Theory the game is designed.
- Phase IV: Collect the test result from the players to write the research paper.
